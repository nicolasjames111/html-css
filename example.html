				<p style="font-weight: bold;" >US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has resigned over allegations he discussed US sanctions with Russia before Donald Trump took office.</p> 
				<p>Mr Flynn is alleged to have discussed US sanctions with the Russian ambassador before Mr Trump took office.</p>
				<p>Earlier, US media reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House about the contacts late last month.</p>
				<p>They said that Mr Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.</p>
				<p>Senior Democrats had called for Mr Flynn to be fired.</p>
				<p>It is<b> illegal</b> for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and the calls happened late last year before Mr Flynn was appointed to the administration.</p>
				<p>The national security adviser is appointed by the president to serve as his or her chief adviser on international affairs and defence.</p>
